## Workshop plan:

The participants (18-20) will be divided into 5-6 groups working independently at separate tables on different use cases (lien).
Two projectors are needed: one will be used for the presentation. The second will be used for displaying HERIe as well as presenting results by the groups.

The workshop is composed of 3 parts:
### Part one (xxx, 10:00-18:00)
- Welcome and introduction
- Concept and structure of the HERIe platform
- Introduction to ‘How to upload data?’, ‘Graphical interface’ and ‘Demonstration data’
- Hands-on exercise 1-2 - Automatic ASHRAE classification and reporting
The ASHRAE chapter 24 will be introduced. The adopted classification algorithms will be presented as ASHRAE is in some parts ambiguous.
The participants will be asked to upload their data and evaluate the type of climate. 
- Hands-on exercise 3 – ‘Showcase tool – incorrect RH’
A short theoretical introduction will be presented. The method estimating Air exchange rate will be shown. 
For one climate provided three groups will be asked to determine the parameters of the showcase to:
Keep RH below 30% to avoid corrosion
Keep RH around 60% to provide stabilization of RH demanded in a loan agreement
Keep RH high to avoid the risk of mechanical damage of an object acclimatized to high RH 
- Hands-on exercise 4-5 – ‘Impact tool – rooms’ + ‘Showcase tool – contaminants’
A short introduction to risks caused by gaseous pollutants. 
Participants will be asked to evaluate the risk to a vulnerable object due to gaseous pollution generated outside using the relevant table from ASHRAE. A view of the room in the historical building can be found at https://www.heritagesquare.org/. The pollution level for the location can be found at https://gitnux.org/los-angeles-air-quality-statistics/
They will use the NOx levels from the nearby monitoring station.
As pollution levels in the room will be too high, they will be asked to propose a solution – a showcase – and design its parameters to meet the required NOx level.
- Hands-on exercise 6 – ‘Light damage calculator’
A short introduction to light damage and two light damage calculators.
Participants will be asked to develop a lighting policy for a light-sensitive object – a 19th-century Japanese print with crystal violet – for the next 50 years using LDC1.
- Hands-on exercise 7-9 – ‘Mechanical damage tool’
An introduction to mechanical damage due to environmental variations will be presented.
A set of short hands-on examples will be carried out to make participants familiar with the tool.
A panel painting from the historic church needs to be conserved. Participants will be asked to assess the consequences of various decisions regarding the place of conservation.

### Part two (xxx, 8:30-16:30)
- Hands-on exercise 10 – ‘Fire risk tool’
An introduction to fire risk and J. Tétreault method.
Participants will be asked to evaluate the risk of fire in energy-efficient storage in Veile, Denmark using floor plan, information about collection and class of fire protection.
- Hands-on exercise 11-13 – ‘Chemical degradation tool’
An introduction to chemical degradation will be presented.
Participants will be asked to evaluate the lifetime of the books produced post-1850 using ‘Chemical degradation tool’ and evaluate various preservation methods, active lowering of T, deacidification, and lowering temperature for winter without energy use.
Participants will be asked to evaluate ‘time to lining’ of Salvador Dali’s painting and possible measures will be discussed.
- Hands-on exercise 14 - ‘Light damage calculator’
Participants will be asked to develop and discuss a set of measures for the Yale Centre of British Art where light levels are significantly above the recommended levels. In each group, a different role will be assigned to participants – a director/architect, head of conservation, curator of prints and drawing/painting. The first step will be the evaluation of risk to paintings exposed to the highest light exposures using LDC1. The median annual light dose for UK historic houses provided by David Thickett as well as data from YCBA will be used to evaluate the amount of colour remaining in historic paintings. In the second step, the light exposure data from YCBA will be used to predict colour change in the collection.
- Hands-on exercise 15 – ‘Fire risk tool’ + ‘Chemical degradation tool”
Participants will be asked to make a decision about the optimal level of fire protection in the case of energy-efficient museum storage in central Poland (CMS). On one hand, upgrading the fire protection level as defined by J. Tétreault by one, decreases the predicted loss of value by an order of magnitude. On the other, the capital cost of the storage increases by 30% between the lowest and the highest level. 
One way of looking is comparing the predicted losses due to fire with another large risk –chemical degradation. The high-quality paper will be used as a model material representing low vulnerability to chemical degradation. As CMS will be cool storage with temperature varying between 7-18oC the participants will take correction for lower temperature using ‘Relative lifetime tool’.
- Hands-on exercise 16 – designing the climate control strategy in the museum/painting gallery
Participants will be asked to decide about the climate control in the museum in a historic building being renovated. Each group will make a decision in a different context: a historic house museum with limited resources, a painting gallery supported by rich sponsors, a mixed collection museum in a country actively pursuing sustainability policies, a museum in a developing country adopting practices from the leading museums, tbd.
The participants will be asked to follow the steps as described in the ASHRAE chapter and evaluate environmental risks.
- Feedback and next steps 

## Workshop Use cases (ie. groups)
Group 1 – City Museum
Group 2 – university museum
Group 3 – museum in town affected by crisis
Group 4 – a leading museum asked for help to an important museum in a developing country in designing a climate control strategy
Group 5 – modern painting gallery in a state actively acting against climate change
